## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Pure white (#FFFFFF) to maintain a clean and simple aesthetic.
- Primary color: Pixel blue (#3399FF) for vibrant accents, inspired by retro gaming interfaces.
- Accent color: Pixel yellow (#FFCC33) to highlight calls to action and important information. Its brighter contrast is intended to draw the eye.
- Font: 'Press Start 2P', monospace; mimics 8-bit video game typography for headlines, subheadlines, and body text, fully committing to the retro aesthetic of the landing page.
- Use pixelated icons resembling those from retro video games, providing a visually engaging and thematically consistent experience. Pixel icons should be used liberally to evoke the style of games.
- Pixelated borders on cards and buttons, square box shadows, and grid-based alignments to maintain the 8-bit aesthetic throughout the site's layout. Favor pixel-style, obvious transitions rather than smooth effects.
- Implement 8-bit animations, such as flashing elements and square movements, to enhance the retro feel. Favor animation that replicates low frame rate flashing lights and obvious blocky movement.
